## Experience
`2022 - current`
__Amazon - Principal Software Engineer - Amazon Infrastructure Services (AIS)__

Principal contributor to the design and evolution of highly available, reliable, and scalable platform services supporting one of the worldâ€™s largest networks.

Developed AWS native platforms that modernized network incident management, network modeling, and EC2 workload placement. Designed and launched systems that reduced average network large scale incident diagnosis time from hours to minutes, reduced customer impact due to configuration defects and enabled 99.98% automated network recovery. These systems underpin multiple internal initiatives and external AWS services, including CloudWatch Internet Monitor and AWS Network Health Inspector. Implemented a hierarchical network topology API that enabled optimisation of customer workload placement and internal EC2/SageMaker operations, resulting in lower customer latency, reduced network congestion, and a $200M/month cost reduction in ML model training workloads.

Partnered with organizational leadership to shape the long term technical strategy and vision for the Infrastructure Services org. Drove cross functional initiatives, aligning local technical leads and external product teams to deliver strategic machine learning and infrastructure goals. Led architecture, API design, and system modeling efforts focused on improving platform availability, reliability, and operational excellence. Delivered features to production end to end with a hands on approach, from design through delivery, deployment and ongoing support. Elevated engineering standards by mentoring team members, training new talent, and actively participating in high bar technical recruiting. Championed operational best practices and reliability focused culture, contributing to measurable gains in SLOs for system performance and availability.

`2014 - 2022`
__Amazon - Senior Software Development Engineer__
Technical lead in the Network Availability Engineering organization, responsible for designing, building, and operating large-scale distributed systems for stream processing, anomaly detection, and network assurance. Developed and deployed systems leveraging statistical and probabilistic models to aggregate, correlate, and classify network events, enabling rapid identification of critical issues. Played a key role in building and scaling multiple successful engineering teams in collaboration with organizational leadership. Mentored and trained junior engineers and contributed to hiring efforts through technical interviews and candidate evaluation.

`2010 - 2014`
__Maynooth University - Lecturer/Tutor__
Delivered lectures, tutorials, and hands-on lab sessions across a range of undergraduate Computer Science modules, including Intro to Programming, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Software Testing. Developed and maintained course content, programming assignments, and assessment materials tailored to a broad spectrum of student experience levels. Provided practical programming guidance and academic support to students in both individual and group settings. Supervised multi week Web Development group projects, guiding students through design, implementation, and presentation phases.
