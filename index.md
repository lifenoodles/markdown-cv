## Summary
Principal Software Engineer at Amazon with a focus on large-scale distributed systems. I design and build highly available, fault tolerant services that support critical AWS and EC2 operations, including systems for network modeling, incident management, and intelligent workload placement.

I specialize in system design, performance engineering, and pragmatic application of statistical and machine learning techniques to domain problems. Proficient in Clojure, Java, Python, and C/C++, with experience in API design, observability, SRE, IaC and AWS native architecture. I lead architecture definition, contribute to long term org wide technical strategy, and drive high impact cross functional initiatives.

My approach combines hands on development with technical leadership, mentoring, and a commitment to raising engineering standards through design rigor and operational excellence. I hold multiple patents related to network telemetry and routing as well as applications of unsupervised learning methods to network incident management. I have a particular interest in open/extensible specifications for data transfer, the fractal properties of good software design, and the epochal time model.

## Experience
`2022 - current`
__Amazon - Principal Software Engineer - Amazon Infrastructure Services (AIS)__

Principal contributor to the design and evolution of highly available, reliable, and scalable platform services supporting one of the worldâ€™s largest networks.

Developed AWS native platforms that modernized network incident management, network modeling, and EC2 workload placement. Designed and launched systems that reduced average network large scale incident diagnosis time from hours to minutes, reduced customer impact due to configuration defects and enabled 99.98% automated network recovery. These systems underpin multiple internal and external AWS services, including CloudWatch Internet Monitor and Network Health Indicator. Implemented a hierarchical network topology API that enabled optimisation of customer workload placement and internal EC2/SageMaker operations, resulting in lower customer latency, reduced network congestion, and a $200M/month cost reduction in ML model training workloads.

Partnered with organizational leadership to shape the long term technical strategy and vision for the Infrastructure Services org. Drove cross functional initiatives, aligning local technical leads and external product teams to deliver strategic machine learning and infrastructure goals. Led architecture, API design, and system modeling efforts focused on improving platform availability, reliability, and operational excellence. Delivered features to production end to end with a hands on approach, from design through delivery, deployment and ongoing support. Elevated engineering standards by mentoring team members, training new talent, and actively participating in high bar technical recruiting. Championed operational best practices and reliability focused culture, contributing to measurable gains in SLOs for system performance and availability.

`2014 - 2022`
__Amazon - Senior Software Development Engineer__
Technical lead in the Network Availability Engineering organization, responsible for designing, building, and operating large-scale distributed systems for stream processing, anomaly detection, and network assurance. Developed and deployed systems leveraging statistical and probabilistic models to aggregate, correlate, and classify network events, enabling rapid identification of critical issues. Played a key role in building and scaling multiple successful engineering teams in collaboration with senior leadership. Mentored and trained junior engineers and contributed to hiring efforts through technical interviews and candidate evaluation.

`2010 - 2014`
__Maynooth University - Lecturer/Tutor__
